Oh, ho, ho...

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.320
Because of less pollution,
I can finally see my subreddit- r/SaimanSays

Ayy, I am sorry. I cannot do
any controversial jokes now.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.600

But, don't worry. This time we're doing
a different kinda Dandi March.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.120
Oh, my God! How can you
miss this opportunity?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.540
How can you not use 'suprised CarryMinati
face' instead of 'suprised Pikachu face'?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.380
Guys, come on!

"Some say he's better in gaming..."
"But deep down inside, we all know...

After this video, Carry's
definitely gonna block me.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.800
But, it's okay, guys.
As a creator, I understand.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.160
Sometimes, there's an urge from the inside-
to try something different.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.880
But, of course, that does not
mean you should make a song

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.760
But...you get the point, right?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.200
"Dark humour is like citizenship."
"Not everyone gets it."

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.880
But I have a dream that one day all Indians
would get the dark and dank humour.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.980
I have a dream...

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.660
That's what happened in
Bandra a day before yesterday.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.980
So, everyone went there for free Wi-Fi.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.640
Tsk.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.800
When you accidentally use 'le' or
'nobody' format on Saiman's subreddit-

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.625
"Me: Forgive me, Om Sai Man."

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.860
I didn't put 'nobody'.
See!?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.520
That is what I am trying to say.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.980
There's no need for 'nobody'.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.280
But some people still use
that for "extra humour".

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.705
There's no need for 'nobody'!

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:11.820
If your meme is funny enough,
there's no need for-

India is the most depressed
country in the world,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.660
Is this true!?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.180
I mean, I've heard that
India is very depressed.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.460
...in the entire world.
I've read that.

It's okay, though.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.880
Robert Downey Jr. is a big superstar.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.100
But these TikTokers have a bigger ego.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.620

make good content on TikTok.

I saw this meme earlier,
and ever since then

I'm very curious to see what
knowledge this video has to offer.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.080
I am curious. I am curious
what this video has to say.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.640
So let's take a look at this video.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.680
Okay, guys. We clearly under-
estimated Techno Antesh.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.540
This video already has 32k views.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.620
Techno Antesh seems
to be a genius, guys.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.180
Saiman: Okay.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.100
Saiman: This is what I don't do. I don't ask
for likes and subscription in the beginning.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.480
That's why my channel
growth is slow. Shi-

I mean...is your home on Sunburn's stage?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.680
I think, this advice was followed
by every struggling YouTuber.

00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:47.765
I too went on random Facebook
groups to share my video.

00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:51.860
At least, I got a satisfaction that
my videos were everywhere.

I've ever seen. Wow.

How much snake oil
would you sell? Huh?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.800
But there are a lot of things in this universe,
which do not make sense.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.800
And Techno Antesh
is an omniscient baba.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.800
So, I am going to listen to this tip,
and I am going to apply it.

TBH honest, nowadays people hit Amit
Bhadana on the net just to look "cool".

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.760
I made a roast on him because
his content was misogynistic.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.060
I made fun of the Mehnat song because...

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.275
Well, I guess...that deserved
to be made fun of.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.180
So I cannot hate that, okay?

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.460
If he's gonna shit, I'll be
the first one to roast him.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.960

20 million. So, I'll be ready.

I am so glad that I did not make
any video about Neha Dhupia.

messaged me the same on Instagram.

make a video about this.

because if I were a smart YouTuber,
I would have avoided this meme.

Now is such a heinous Kaliyuga
that even Gods are in lockdown.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.220
The Gods did this because
of overpopulation.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.360
That is why the weak die,
and the strong ones live.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.480
OR that is why the poor die,
and the rich ones live.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.860
