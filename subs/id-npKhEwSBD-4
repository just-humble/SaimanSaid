YTFF?
Ehm! More like WTFF.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.960
[laugh track]

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.460
[swoosh]
See, I like YouTube fanfest, okay.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.740
See, I like YouTube fanfest, okay.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.340
I appreciate the hard work.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.180
The MEHNAT
that has been put into these events,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.760
The MEHNAT, the time,
that has been put into these events,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.460
The MEHNAT, the time, and the money
that's put into these events,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.180
and to make these events happen.
I appreciate that.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.940
But–
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.340
But if you say that these events don't have
any cringe moments, then you're lying to yourself.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.540
Personally, I haven't attended the YTFF because
my favourite youtuber, 🅱-series, wasn't invited.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.160
That is why I did not attend YouTube fanfest.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.660
But, it's okay, I saw it online.
I saw it on YouTube.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.780
Now, it's a big event by YouTube,
and it deservesa reaction video.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.700
Right, Prajakta?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.960
[sniggers]
Right, Prajakta?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.640
Prajakta: Thane can be called Mumbai,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.560
if reaction videos can be
called original content.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.900
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.100
[in Marathi]
🅱rajakta, I'll see you later.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.520
Now I may not have attended YTFF, but Say Sena
made their presence felt throughout the show.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.060
This particular tweet, throughout the show,
came up 20-30 times.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.620
Fun Fact: Nobody invited 🅱-series to YTFF,
completely agree with you @HiSaimandar

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.120
Srinidhi Sharma,
thank you, very cool.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.960
There are many things in YTFF– song and
dance performances, comedy sketches,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.260
but the staple of YTFF is

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.460
ＣＲＩＮＧＥ

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.960
Hehehe!

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.620
So we start with Amit Bhadana.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.440
Nobody:
Amit Bhadana: Oye hoye (x2), oh ho hoho.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.740
First of all, JordIndian is a youtuber duo,
and they both hosted the show very well.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.220
But host how well you can, you can't
handle this level of cringe. I'm sorry.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.640
So, JordIndian called upon Amit Bhadana, announcing that he (Amit) is the most subscribed man in Indian YT.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.180
Jord 1: Man with the most amount
of subcribers in India!

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.860
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.720
Jord 2: Electric Boogaloo:
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for...

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.760
So my theory is that majority
of the audience still thinks

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.240
that Bhuvam Bam is the highest
subscribed independent youtuber in India.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.360
See how I needed to clarify by stating "independent".
If 🅱-series weren't on the top,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.880
then I'd directly stated that
he's the highest subscribed youtuber.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.560
👏 Enough, Saiman, enough. 👏
(CHEEK 👏 REVIEW 👏)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.340
👏 How much would you talk about 🅱-series?👏
(CHEEK 👏 REVIEW 👏)

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.100
👏 How much 👏 would you 👏talk about 🅱-series?👏
(Report video → Self harm)

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.780
So, I was saying that the audience
still cannot digest the fact that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.300
that Amit Bhadana has
taken over BB ki Vines.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.040
That's why when JordIndian said he's the
highest subscribed man in Indian YouTube,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.300
the audience cheered.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.800
Jord 1: The highest amount of subscribers in India!

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.440
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.940
Jord 2: Ladies-
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940
But when they said Amit Bhadana,
they booed.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.420
[smacks lips]
they booed.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.060
Jord 2: Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.100
Both Jords: AMIT 🅱HADANA!

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.280
[audience boos for a reason]

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280
Wait, wait.
Hold up (x4).

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.900
Now see, I'm one of the
biggest critics of Amit Bhadana of YouTube,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.620
and even I felt bad for this.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.460
Nobody:
Amit Bhadana: Oye hoye (x2), oh ho hoho.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.620
Cheer up once, please.
I want an earache ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.820
Serve some water to the audience at the back.
There's no sound from the back.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.780
So as I said, Amit Bhadana wasn't getting
a proper reaction from the Mumbai audience,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.460
and that was becoming painfully
obvious in the next few minutes.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.620
Amit: Just shout a little bit.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.620
[audience cheers for no reason]
Amit: Just shout a little bit.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.240
Not for me, shout for everyone.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.980
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.040
Shitty translation:
My friends fight for 5 Star everyday.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.260
Shitty translation: 
Without eating Cadbury's 5 Star, they have no fun.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.740
Shitty translation:
What do I do?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.420
I didn't ever think that this would happen,
but I've a new unique emotion inside of me.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.740
I'm feeling sad for Amit Bhadana.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.660
Amit: Thank you so much. Yours lovely.
In the end, I'd like to add something.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.840
I talk less, my work says more.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.920
He shat.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.440
I was actually starting to support
Amit Bhadana a bit, sympathetically, in this act.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.720
But by saying this, he shat.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.220
I talk less, my work says more.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.700
[shows how he talks less]

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.180
I talk less, my work says more.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.000
"I talk less, but my work says more. That's why I made
a 7 minute music video for my introduction."

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.560
[Amit Bhadana's song plays]

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.520
Honestly, If Amit Bhadana could've sung his song,
even lip-synced, it'd have been okay.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.880
Just anything else would have been better than this.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.220
Nobody:
Amit Bhadana: Oye hoye (x2), oh ho hoho.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.820
Nobody:
Amit Bhadana: Just shout a little bit.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.700
Moving on to our next youtuber, Technical Guruji.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.000
Technical Guruji: So let's...
Audience: start with it.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.640
Technical Guruji: So let's unbox.
[audience cries]

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.720
So, Technical Guruji's act was to unbox a large box,
live on stage, and out came Mumbiker Nikhil from it.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.580
But I didn't understand one thing.
Why did he say this after the unboxing?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.060
What did you guys do?

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.280
What's this joke?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.700
Then, of course, we have
Mumbiker Nikhil's performance.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.420
Mumbiker Nikhil...um.....

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.100
[smacks lips]
Mumbaiker Nikhil...um..... Danced.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.360
Whatever Mumbiker Nikhil did, it was decent.
I am happy that he didn't perform his song.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.380
♪ Your bro, your Mumbiker ♪

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.720
This Mumbiker Nikhil...

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.420
you do copy Casey Neistat, right?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.960
Casey Neistat never made a song,
why are you?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.220
Technical Guruji: Guys, how do you like
my most popular unboxing till date?

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.460
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.100
Mumbiker Nikhil: Forget the unboxing.
How was my dance?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.740
"Frick that stupid unboxing.
Give me attention."

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.820
Mumbiker Nikhil: Forget the unboxing.
How was my dance?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.780
Technical Guruji: Without my unboxing,
how'd there be a dance, my brøther?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.560
I think Mumbiker Nikhil
took his dance very emotionally.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.500
He was proud of his dance.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.780
He didn't just ask about it once,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.400
but asked about the same again
some time later on the show.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.780
Host: What about you, Nikhil?
Random girl: Jeez!

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.060

After that, Technical Guruji brings
Mo Vlogs on the stage too.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.120
Technical Guruji: And a surprise for you all.
Not from here, guys, not from here.

[audience cheers for no reason]

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.060
See that. When he said "not from here",
everyone cheered.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.860
Technical Guruji:
Not from here, guys, not from here.

They support this!
They don't invite our Indian youtuber 🅱-series.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.040
I said that the fanfest guys are anti-nationalists.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.280
And then there's a channel called 'Rimorav vlogs'.
They hosted backstage segments throughout the show.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.980

By the way, the tweet is still up.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.960
The cringe come in when they try
the same ol' comedy routine.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.880
Me and my friend, very Punjabi.
But one change.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.120
We speak so-so English,
and you speak so much English.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.000
And...we learn from Mo.
[Ah, that's why it's shit]

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.300
But where you learn,
I need to know.

"See how poor my English is.
So I'd impress a girl by my broken English."

Technical Guruji: 
What did you guys do? What's this joke?

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.480
Ashish Chanchlani did...

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.640
Ashish Chanchlani did
perform good on the stage.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.300
See, YouTube isn't an app, it's a court.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.240
This court has 2 apartments on its top floor.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.540
In one apartment lives Pewdiepie baba.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.860
And in the second one lives 🅱-series baba!

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.860
Whose side are you on?

Aye don't do this.
There would a fight. No, no, no.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.660
That was really funny.
Very good, Ashish Chanchlani.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.000
Uh, by the way, I saw
Pewdiepie's new disstrack "Congratulations",

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.720
and I think I should share
my thoughts on it.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.360

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.660
Yeah, okay. I won't say anything.
Yeah, okay.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.400
So yeah, as I was saying,
Ashish Chanchlani's act was good,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.580
but I had a small problem in that.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.220
Ashish: KLPD...uhm.

Oi, why are you fapping

Oh, it's a bottle. It's a bottle.
[audience cheers for no reason]

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.820
Is there a tax for doing clean comedy?
No, no, I am just asking,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.240
because almost every youtuber
relies on vulgarity for comedy.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.880
Do adult comedy, I have no problem.
But it should have a thing called humour at the least.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.300
Homour is not saying "fapping" in public.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.260
But he knows that by saying this,
he would get a reaction.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.560
And the 15 year olds in the audience
find this as a sort of rebellious thing.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.620
"[laughs] Did you hear what he said on the stage?
He said "fapping". [laughs]

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.840
I like that when he said this vulgar thing,
the camera cut towards 3 young girls.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.360
I haven't edited this, okay. This is original.
You can check it on YouTube.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.900
Who..
who's editing this?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.160
Moving on towards our next youtuber,
MostlyLame.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.440
[audience cheers for no reason]
Okay, listen...

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.400
when you subscribe...

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.580
Audience: ring the bell icon!

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.260
So when I come online,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.740
Audience: our phones would ring.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.300
See, I know that this is your catchphrase.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.040
But why are you begging for likes and
subscribers in the opening of your act?

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.180
What's up, Mumbai?

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.200
Welcome to YTFF,
or as you may like to call it:

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.020
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Lilly Singh!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.720
[Saiman is confusion]
Who is calling YTFF as Lilly Singh?
What does this mean?

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.600
Thane can be called Mumbai, if reaction
videos can be called original content.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.560
I said it first!
[laughs]

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.500
['nam flashacks]
...if reaction videos can be called original content.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.560
I said it first!
[laughs]

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.340
"I said it first! See how courageous I am,
how outspoken of a girl I am."

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.940
"I said it first!"
[laughs mockingly]

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.500
That is a good roast.
it's a really good roast.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.760
I think the joke was understood by 
the people who live near Mumbai.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.500
But it is a bit ironic and weird that a youtuber
who is basically a pirated copy of Lilly Singh

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.260
is talking about original content.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.580
We went from 30k subcribers to 3.5 million.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.820
Then she says something which is
a reference to one of her videos,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.620
and after that,
she says this.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.520
Did we just plug our video on stage?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.540
Like and...

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.760
Audience: Subscribe!

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.040
Technical Guruji: 
What did you guys do? What's this joke?

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.640
This remind me of what
Bhuvan Bam said on the red carpet.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.120
We all are begging for likes and subscribers
at the end of our videos, why don't you ever?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.480
I think that whoever likes my content would
like it, and would subscribe my channel.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.540
Alright, that's it for this video. 
Don't get me wrong. I like the show.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.820
In my opinion, Amanda Cerny and
Bhuvan Bam performed very nice.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.340
Bhuvan Bam's Titu Talks is an amazing concept.
I liked the Johnny Sins episode.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.360
But as a fan, I'd give a feedback to YTFF that-
please, fix your audio.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.020
For example, when Lilly Singh performed her song,
and there was a guy next to her.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.280
You hear the mic volumes of both of them.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.040
This happened too many
times throughout the show.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.320
And I always read in the comments,
"There's no noise from the audience",

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.780
"Why is the audience so silent?"

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.660
I believe that this could
also be a technical glitch.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.380
I believe the volume of the mic capturing
the audience's noise was kept low.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.320
If you can't hear the audience in a love show,
then the fun of the live show is stripped away.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.480
So, I hope they fix this issue by next year.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.280
Mumbiker Nikhil: How was my dance?

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.060
