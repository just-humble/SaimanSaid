Welcome to Saiman Says, everybody.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.760
Ever since I heard about that 10-year challenge,
I knew I had to do this video.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.940
Back in 2009, I made this video which I later uploaded on this YT channel in 2011 when I started this YT channel.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.420
It is the first video on this YT channel, and today,
I am going to recreate that video.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.140
Right now, I'm at Bandra Bus Depot,
and this bus depot is directly opposite to my school.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.360
And back in 2009, after my school hours,
me and my friends used to come over here

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.640
in this bus depot and 
we used to just goof around.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.520
We've made a lot of videos in this
particular place, and that video,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.620
which is the first video on my channel
is just one of those videos.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
So today, in this video, I'm going to recreate the first video which I uploaded on this channel, and...

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.080
especially for that, I've called
all of my school friends.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.100
