00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.720
Hello everybody! Welcome to Saiman Plays

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.400
Yes, another gameplay video
because I'm running out of content...

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.400
Today we are going to be playing this game
'Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy'

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.800
This is one of the most popular rage games in the world

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.880
And recently it has become very popular in India because of CarryMinati

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.400
(CarryMinati cursing at the game
and breaking his monitor)

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.120
I have attached lime and chillies
(an Indian tradition to be safe from danger)

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.120
So the world record for this game is 2 minutes, people have completed the game in 2 minutes

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.780
But Im going to break that record guys,
Im going to complete this game in one minute

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.320
(Surprised CarryMinati face)

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.540
How does this work?

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.680
I've seen gameplays...

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.560
I've seen Pewdiepie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Carryminati, Beastboy Shub play this game

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.280
T-Series Owner - "He's not still mature enough"

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.940
Bennett Foddy, you think you are really smart???

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.200
Why isnt he going ahead?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.320
Nothing will happen by clicking right?
I just have to move the mouse

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.740
There are actually no controls in this game,
you have to just move the cursor

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.640
Damn!

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.380
Damn !!!

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200
I think getting over this is going to be even tougher than getting over my... (*heartbreak*)

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.680
Almost done! Almost done! Wow

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.620
I din't ask for your expert opinion Bennet Foddy!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.560
Ok Bennet, thank you for your kind advice

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.920
I think I need a bigger mousepad for this game

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.060
I have this Amazon Basics mousepad, its so small

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640
Yes! This is the furthest Ive been in this game

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.860
Plis gaem, plis gaem, plis

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.500
Don't promote your other game when im already frustrated with this game, Bennett

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.820
Fodi !!! (Fodi = pimple)

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.420
Did I ask you about Sexy Hiking???

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.120
Im not losing my cool, everybody, Im just trying to be entertaining in front of camera

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.740
Im just being energetic,
Im not losing my cool over a game

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.840
Why is this so tough

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.540
mouse sensitivity ?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.340
No I think its fine

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.360
Okay !!!

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.140
( mic falls off )

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.860
Almost there... Almost there...

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.020
We'll just push a bit and jump, okay?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.140
3-2-1- Lets go !!!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.840
Almost there...Almost there...

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.460
I dare you to speak about Sexy hiking again,
Bennett Foddy ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.720
I almost fell

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.040
Im coming here for the 5th time...

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.840

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.000
Where was my mic ???

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.080
When did my mic fall off ???

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.100
Dont tell me that I couldnt record audio till now!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.180
FFFFFFFFFF ----------------

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.100
Bennet Foddy pls ğŸ˜¢

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.100
Take 100 rupees more,
and make me reach to the top of the mountain

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.860
Bennett Foddy ......

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.260
I will feed you Toddy Chicken, Bennett Foddy

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.740
This is supposed to be so easy...

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.600
grab that one lamp and another lamp

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.460
You have to hook-up with those lamps!

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.700
(Saiman's descent towards insanity begins)

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.080
Im going to reach to the top of this
Manjhi the Mountain Man simulator

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.320
What should i do now! Im stuck again

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.040
Now you've to just push upwards okay Saiman?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.320
Its done! You've passed the toughest part...

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.660

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.400
Bennett Foddy ...

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.020
I'll fod (break) your face

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.180
Dont interrupt my gameplay!

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040
This again ???

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.700
I cant do this lamp part again

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.340
Im sorry guys today's video is not PG

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.600
You idiot!

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.080
Im followed by a dog...

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.780
that was nice

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.120
Im going to find a youtube compilation of these quotes,
I really liked these quotes

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.320
Can we just enter that
house/platform, whatever it is safely ?

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.460
What should I do now

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.880
Ohhh frick

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.700

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.560

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720
I think we've to go right

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.900
I've a very bad feeling that if I fall through that,
Im going to quit this game

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.580
Ok we've to jump to those boxes now

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.620
Ok? Slowly

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.500
What ?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.480
Just move the mouse in circles

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.860
C'mon Saiman... Very bad

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.240
