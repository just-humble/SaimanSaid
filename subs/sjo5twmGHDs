00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.540
I bought a bunch of billboards

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.240
As you can see I've purchased all the billboards here in India and I'm going to promote T-Series.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.600
 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.380
Please go and subscribe ok?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.680
 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.800
T-Series T-Series T-Series T-Series

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.480
And much more to make sure that T-Series beats Pewdiepie as soon as possible.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.420
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.500
Welcome to Saiman Says

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.780
Today in this video Im going to promote
T-Series throughout India

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.100
Pewdiepie, your time is up

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.120
And Mr. Beast, you think you can save Pewdiepie?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.840
Today in this video Im going to make sure that T-Series wins as soon as possible

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.740
And yeah, the real reason I support T-Series is because if I don't support T-Series I'll be termed as an Anti-National

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.480
by the real Indian 'patriots'

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.140
that is the reason why I support T-Series.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.200
And I hate Pewdiepie because... He said.. uh..

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.760
bad things about our country 
and he said bad things about Indians

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160
Although he did not mean it and said it in sarcasm,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.060
I don't understand sarcasm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.340
That is why I hate Pewdiepie ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.880
As you can see I've purchased all the billboards in India

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.100
and I'm going to promote T-Series as much as I can.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.620
 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.260
And as I said in my previous video,
I support T-Series whole-heartedly

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.760
I've got 2 T's on my titties

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.780
so without any further ado, let's start

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.700
