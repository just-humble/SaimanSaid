Nice intro for the show, but...

It's a joke on reservation,

Lakshay Choudhary is a YouTuber.
He's a really good YouTuber.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.860
and I am in touch with him on Instagram,
you know. We chat on Instagram and all, but...

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.060
recently he did a boo-boo!

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.340
He gave a few YouTubers copyright
claims, and took their videos down,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.880
just because those
YouTubers were criticising him.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.740
And he did not claim them himself.
He did this through a company,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.040
which is a clear misuse of
the copyright system on YouTube.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.760
So, that is why most of the Indian meme
community has been making fun of Lakshay bhaiya.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.340
And it is very weird that
Laksay bhaiya got offended

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.580
because he is the CEO
of dank humour in India.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.560

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.340
If...

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.080
If you learn English, and you have
an accent different than Indian,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.640
it doesn't mean
you're intelligent.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.500
at the Treemathon livestream
on Tanmay Bhat's channel.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.440
That day I was not Saiman,
I was SaiManmohan.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
- Saiman, say something, no.
You are so quiet.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.940
- Saiman, yeah, why are you being very quiet?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.580
- I am a big fan of Saiman.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.640
- [unintelligible] as given 10,000...

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.960
- But that is because I am
very introvert in real life.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.840
Having a stage fear and being
an introvert are two different things.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.640
I like to perform in
front of an audience.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.520
That is not a problem for me, but the
problem for me is to socialise with people.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.520
So, that's what happened
on Treemathon livestream.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.060

and I was meeting his friends,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.580
I love this meme format just because of
how awkward I look in this, guys. I mean...

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.860
But we raised a lot of money. So, if 
there was cringe, it was for a good cause.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.240
So the cringe cancels out.

Guys, this is such a good meme,
but why 'Le'?

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.900
Why did you write 'Le'?

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.060
Huh? Are you from Ladakh?
Huh?

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.020
It's an old thing. We used it
in rage comics 10 years ago.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.020
Now there's no need to write 'Le' here.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.280
I've already cancelled the 'Nobody' memes,
now I am cancelling the 'Le' ones too.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.780
Please don't write 'Le'.
(sad French noises)

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.360
I am sorry, guys.
I have to be strict with you.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.000
If not, how India will
become dank? Huh?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Why are you staring at my cleavage?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.080
Because I love partition.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.280
It's a Gandhiji meme,
so it should be funny.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.280
Laugh. A memer has
made a meme. Laugh.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.200

to feel about it? Huh?

Don't remain normie, guys.
Understood?

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.020

political jokes on this channel,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.240
but guys, this was
a good meme, okay.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.640
Ay, it's not like I joke
only on Modiji, okay.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.040
I did one on Pakistan today.
Did I not? I did, right?

Guy: Feel it, sir. Feel it.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.240
Another guy: No, sir, you
can feel anything...

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.020

different human being.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.840
