You guys have submitted a lot of memes
on my subreddit r/SaimanSays,

how normie they are. So, uh...

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.560

It's been a year since I created the subreddit,

Forgive me. It's just like that.

Do I give a fake laugh to this meme?
[laughs in fake]

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.140

It's a nobody meme, okay, fine.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.540
Now we cut the 'Nobody' part out.
Okay. The meme just reads, "14 year olds...

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.500
...when somebody unfollows them on Instagram."
Okay, that is the meme. Ok.

It's not like this. Even Indian youtubers
do a lot for social causes.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.080
For example, CarryMinati had donated
for the Bihar flood victims recently.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.200
And also, this meme applies to us
as well because we all closed our eyes.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200
We pretended to not see when Sadhguru
had initiated the 'Cauvery Calling' mission.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.700
And in my opinion, we should first donate
to Cauvery Calling before TeamTrees,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.080
because Cauvery Calling is in India.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.460
First we concentrate on what's happening
in India, then we do it for TeamTrees.

I was on a debate on a news channel on national TV.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.640
Anchor: Saimandar Waghdhare, a YouTuber, and...
Saimandar: They want people to...

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.820
...report about the potholes,
but I think the execution is very bad.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.720
I mean, it reminds me of this game
that was 2 years ago.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.920
It's called Pokémon Go.
- Correct!

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.000
- No, I said the intent was nice, but the execution
is very bad. They're trying to show this as a trend.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.360
They're trying to cater to the youth, but...

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.040
No, I want to know that
what if I find a 2 inch deep pothole?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.820
- That doesn't make the cut.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.500
- Why? Size should not matter.
- (sighs) Right.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.800
- Like, any pothole is a pothole...
Man: Can I suggest an idea?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.920
Anchor: Yes.
Saimandar: They're trying to say that...

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.740
...you click a selfie with a pothole.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.560
They should also launch another campaign which says,
"Click a selfie with the victims of those potholes."

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.840
Okay, I know it is a bit cringy,
but I was very nervous, okay?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.980
It was my first time on
a news channel on live TV,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.640
and I was totally not prepared for this.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.580
I mean, they informed me
3 hours prior to the debate.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.940
And I was preparing for my CarryMinati shoot.
I was doing some shopping.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.460
And they told me that the debate is in 3 hours, and...

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.980
But I had no choice. I had to do this to represent
Say Sena on a news channel on national TV, right?

Shiv Sena minister resigns from
cabinet only to comment about Saiman.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:11.000

I saw this. I saw this news,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.460
and I felt really sad, because I did not
know about this YouTuber before this news.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.840
This YouTuber, Grandpa Kitchen, was very old, okay?
And he used to cook food in his YouTube channel,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.520
told the recipes, and fed the orphans.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.680
It is very sad that I heard about
this YouTuber after this news.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.580
I mean, I don't know what the people
at Fan Fest and Social Nation are doing.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.680
They always call the same gang of 5 YouTubers.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.920
And people like this,
YouTubers like these, come and go away.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.140
It'd have been much better if I heard a "How was the food?" instead of "How was the dance?" on Fan Fest.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.280

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.260
Okay, thank you for this supportive meme, but...
What is a loyal fan base?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.800
I don't know what is a loyal fan base.

If I ask you to subscribe to T-series,
would you do it?

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.980
I don't think I want a loyal fan base,
I want a logical fan base.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.740
If you're gonna talk about loyal fan base,
I think CarryMinati has the most loyal fan base in India.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:01.060
But the thing is, loyalty and toxicity has a very fine line between them, and people cross them a lot of the time.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:07.760
For example, if you criticise CarryMinati just a little bit,
you'd get a list of curse words due to the toxic fans.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.320
But I am not saying that all CarryMinati fans are toxic.
It is a very small part of his fan base which is toxic.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.940
The same with PewDiePie.
A big part of his fan base is toxic.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.220
So, I'd prefer to have a logical
fan base instead of loyal fan base.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.780
Aw, thank you so much for this Sai-Man artwork.

Carry lost to Saiman.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:35.300
Actually, you see, CarryMinati did not win that match,
because CarryMinati should be disqualified in the end.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.760
Because he was puching me repeatedly, am I right?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.380
The referee too wanted to stop him,
but CarryMinati did not listen.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.500
So, as per boxing rules, CarryMinati
should've got negative marking there.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.160
And if you see the full boxing match, as per boxing rules,
I think the match was a draw.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.440
That is why I am planning that
there would a rematch next year,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.840
and that video would get me double
the views and more money, right?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.560
